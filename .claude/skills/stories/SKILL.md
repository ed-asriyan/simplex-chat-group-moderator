# Stage 1: user stories

You are doing **only** the user-stories stage of the process in `AGENTS.md` for: $ARGUMENTS

The project's own values — where the stories are, how a story id looks, how stories are written there — are in `AGENTS.md` *Workflow*. Read it first, and `docs/design.md` *Overview* and *Components*, so the stories use the system's terms. If they do not say something this skill needs, ask the maintainer.

## Scope
- Edit the stories document.
- If you renumber stories, also update the references to the old ids wherever they are (code comments, tests, other docs). No other change.
- Touch nothing else: no design, no ports, no schema, no code, no tests.

## Steps
1. Read the stories document in full, so the new stories stay consistent with the rest.
2. If the behaviour is ambiguous (a case the request does not decide, a conflict with an existing story), ask the maintainer before writing.
3. Decide which stories the request touches. A story is one user flow: one thing a person does and what they get back.
   - **The request changes what happens in a flow that already has a story** (another reply, a different text, a new case of the same action): **edit that story in place**. Do not add a story, a sub-story or a note elsewhere that patches it. Each existing story whose flow is affected gets the change; if the same outcome is described in several stories, update each one.
   - **Add a new story only for a new flow**: a person can do something they could not do before, or the system does something on its own in a situation no story covers.
4. Write every story in the project's form (*Workflow*). Whatever the form, a story is **"As a \<role\>, when I \<concrete action\>, \<what I get\>"**:
   - The action is concrete and physical, with real values, never an abstraction such as "when I change a setting".
   - What follows is what each person involved observes, with the exact wording of any text that matters, written out in the story itself; don't send the reader to another story for "the same reply".
   - A general rule (who owns what, what persists) is a sentence inside the story it belongs to, never a story of its own without an actor and an action.
5. Write the stories as the current intended behaviour: rewrite or remove stories that no longer apply, don't keep history. A removed or renamed behaviour is simply not mentioned: never write that it "no longer exists", "was replaced" or "is gone".
6. A new flow gets a new id; never renumber to make room. If you do renumber, grep the repository for every old id and list the test files a later stage will have to update.
7. If the request does not change behaviour (a refactoring, a rename in code), say so and change nothing.

## Finish
Show the diff of the stories document, list the story ids you added, changed or removed, and **stop**. The next stage is `/design`, run by the maintainer after review.
